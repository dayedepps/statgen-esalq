_**Augusto**_ is the Faculty responsible for the Lab.
He is also responsible for maintaining this web page. His professional
web page is
[http://augusto-garcia.github.io/](http://augusto-garcia.github.io/).
For more information about him on the web, check his
[about.me](http://about.me/augusto.garcia) page.

Augusto's research goals include having a better understanding of the
genetic architecture of quantitative traits, through linkage and QTL
mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection. Most of his
activities involve sugarcane, a complex autopolyploid species that
does not fully benefit from molecular markers technology, but many
other plant species have also been studied.

He is also an enthusiastic of free software, and has been using Linux
for many years. He strongly supports and encourage the usage of R,
Emacs, LaTeX, and git, among many other software and tools.

## PhD Students

#### Adriana Cheavegatti Gianotto (by herself)

_**Adriana**_ is an Agronomist by Federal University of Viçosa. She
started her career while still undergraduate student working at
BIOAGRO at the Plant-Pathogen Genetic Interaction Laboratory. During
her Master Degree at the Genetics Department of the same University,
she mapped a chromosome region of the tomato genome related to
geminiviruses resistance, for further positional cloning of a major
gene (Ty-1).

Currently, she is engaged at her PhD at Department of Genetics (Luiz
de Queiroz College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo). She is
evaluating the use of Structural Equation Models to map QTL
controlling a set of correlated traits of root morphology and
phosphorus acquisition in maize. In addition, she has also worked for
many years in research programs of Biotech Companies such as Alellyx
and Canavialis, which were latter acquired by Monsanto. During this
period, she had the opportunity to work at different phases of
development of genetically modified cultivars of sugarcane, citrus and
eucalyptus, such as plant transformation, field trials, biosafety
studies and regulatory affairs with governmental organizations.

flow and genetic diversity in cotton, and GxE interaction and genetic
mapping in
[sweet passion fruit](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/11/11137/tde-17032011-105123/en.php)
and common bean. His main goal as a researcher is to contribute with
crop breeding programs by using the appropriate tools in statistical
genetics, bioinformatics and molecular biology. Detailed academic CV
might be found [here](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2580756111835509) (only in
Portuguese).


#### João Ricardo Bachega Feijó Rosa (by himself)

_**João Ricardo**_ has an undergraduate degree in Agronomy and is a
PhD Candidate in Genetics and Plant Breeding at Luiz de Queiroz
College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo.

{: .image-pull-right}

He initiated his career as a sugarcane breeder at Federal University
of São Carlos, one of the principal Federal Universities in Brazil
that is responsible for RIDESA, a public country-wide sugarcane
breeding program. During his master degree at Department of Genetics
of the University of São Paulo, João was interested to investigate the
patterns of linkage disequilibrium and population structure on a
Brazilian collection of sugarcane genotypes, a group of historically
important accessions to Brazilian germplasm. His principal interest
while a PhD Candidate is to use coalescent theory and population
genetics concepts to understand the linkage disequilibrium and the
evolutionary past of an important panel of accessions of Sorghum using
next generation sequencing (SNPs from Genotyping-By-Sequencing).
Furthermore, João is also involved into genome-wide association
studies in Sorghum and collaborative projects of linkage analysis and
association mapping of other very important crops for Brazil, such as
common bean, cacao and passion fruit.


#### Carina de Oliveira Anoni (by herself)

_**Carina**_ is a PhD Candidate at the Department of Genetics. She is
an Agronomist and has a Master Degree in Genetics and Plant Breeding.

![carina]({{ site.url }}/images/carina.jpg)
{: .image-pull-right}

In her PhD, she is developing methods of quantitative genetics that
can be applied to phenotypic data, QTL mapping and genetic linkage
maps. The goal of Carina's research is to use statistical methods in
order to have a better understanding the genetic basis of quantitative
traits. Currently, she works on the development of new methodologies for
association mapping in polyploids, focusing on sugarcane.

(selection index) to provide information to breeders about which
individuals should be selected as parent for crossing and which ones
should be selected for commercial production.
