#### Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia

_**Augusto**_ is the Faculty responsible for the Lab.
He is also responsible for maintaining this web page. His professional
web page is
[http://augusto-garcia.github.io/](http://augusto-garcia.github.io/).
For more information about him on the web, check his
[about.me](http://about.me/augusto.garcia) page.

Augusto's research goals include having a better understanding of the
genetic architecture of quantitative traits, through linkage and QTL
mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection. Most of his
activities involve sugarcane, a complex autopolyploid species that
does not fully benefit from molecular markers technology, but many
other plant species have also been studied.

He is also an enthusiastic of free software, and has been using Linux
for many years. He strongly supports and encourage the usage of R,
Emacs, LaTeX, and git, among many other software and tools. 

> "Statistical Genetics is about develop models to have a better
> understanding of genetic data, under (somehow) realistic assumptions

## Postdocs

#### João Ricardo Bachega Feijó Rosa (by himself)
_**João Ricardo**_ has an undergraduate degree in Agronomy, has MSc (2012) and PhD (2016) in Genetics and Plant Breeding at "Luiz de Queiroz"
College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo.

He initiated his career as a sugarcane breeder at Federal University
of São Carlos, one of the principal Federal Universities in Brazil
that is responsible for RIDESA, a public country-wide sugarcane
breeding program. During his master degree at Department of Genetics
of the University of São Paulo, João was interested to investigate the
patterns of linkage disequilibrium and population structure on a
Brazilian collection of sugarcane genotypes, a group of historically
important accessions to Brazilian germplasm. His principal interest
while a PhD Candidate was to use coalescent theory and population
genetics concepts to understand the linkage disequilibrium and the
evolutionary past of an important panel of accessions of Sorghum using
next generation sequencing (SNPs from Genotyping-By-Sequencing).
Furthermore, João is also involved into genome-wide association
studies in Sorghum and collaborative projects of linkage analysis and
association mapping of other very important crops for Brazil, such as
common bean, cacao and passion fruit. For more information about João, please visit his [Lattes CV](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2084381270708398)

He has experience with maize breeding (intern at Monsanto), development of  genetic mixed models and application of Genomic Selection to maize breeding (Federal University of Lavras). Nowadays, he is developing and evaluating Bayesian genetic models using a model-based machine learning approach via Bayesian Networks to analyse phenotypic data from sorghum growth traits collected through time (temporal series) coupled with functional-genome sequencing information (Colaboration, Cornell University - Prof. Dr. Michael Gore). He is interested in quantative genetics, genomic selection, Bayesian models and probabilistic programming (Stan, PyMC3, JAGS, Infer.NET) tools.

{: .image-pull-right}

She has an undergraduate degree in Biology and Master degree in
Genetics and Plant Breeding at Federal University of Lavras (UFLA).
During undergraduate and master, she worked with molecular genetics
focusing on identification of QTL for disease resistance in common
bean. In her PhD, she is working with development of statistical
methods applied to genomic selection in sugarcane. She has
concentrated her studies in Quantitative Genetics, Computing for
Statistical Genetics (especially in R software) and Mixed Models.

#### Luís Felipe Ventorim Ferrão (by himself)

_**Felipe**_ is Biologist and a PhD Candidate in Graduate Program of  Genetics and Plant Breeding (FAPESP grant number 2014/20389-2), University of São Paulo (ESALQ/USP).

His research focuses on the application and development of statistical methods of both computational and statistical tools for genomic prediction. His studies has been concentrated in Computing for Statistical Genetics (especially in R software), mixed models and, more recently, Bayesian approaches. ast research experiences include  genetic diversity studies, development and validation of molecular markers and QTL mapping. Most of his studies are applied in Coffea canephora, one of the coffee species most consumed in the world. 

Currently, he is finishing the PhD studies as visiting student at the University of Chicago (FAPESP Research Internship Abroad), working under supervision of [Matthew Stephens](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/).
