He is also responsible for maintaining this web page. His professional
web page is

Augusto's research goals include having a better understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits, through linkage and QTL mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection. Most of his activities involve sugarcane, a complex autopolyploid species that does not fully benefit from molecular markers technology, but many other plant species have also been studied.

He is also an enthusiastic of free software, and has been using Linux for many years. He strongly supports and encourage the usage of R,
Emacs, LaTeX, and git, among many other software and tools.

## Postdocs

#### João Ricardo Bachega Feijó Rosa (by himself)

_**João Ricardo**_ has an undergraduate degree in Agronomy, has MSc (2012) and PhD (2016) in Genetics and Plant Breeding at "Luiz de Queiroz"
College of Agriculture, University of São Paulo. 
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/JoaoRicardo.jpg" height="120">{: .image-pull-right}

He initiated his career as a sugarcane breeder at Federal University of São Carlos, one of the principal Federal Universities in Brazil that is responsible for RIDESA, a public country-wide sugarcane breeding program. During his master degree at Department of Genetics of the University of São Paulo, João was interested to investigate the patterns of linkage disequilibrium and population structure on a Brazilian collection of sugarcane genotypes, a group of historically important accessions to Brazilian germplasm. His principal interest while a PhD Candidate was to use coalescent theory and population genetics concepts to understand the linkage disequilibrium and the evolutionary past of an important panel of accessions of Sorghum using next generation sequencing (SNPs from Genotyping-By-Sequencing). Furthermore, João is also involved into genome-wide association studies in Sorghum and collaborative projects of linkage analysis and association mapping of other very important crops for Brazil, such as common bean, cacao and passion fruit.

#### Letícia Aparecida de Castro Lara (by herself)

_**Letícia**_ is a PhD candidate at Department of Genetics of the University of São Paulo (ESALQ/USP). <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/Leticia.jpg" height="120">{: .image-pull-right}

She has an undergraduate degree in Biology and Master degree in Genetics and Plant Breeding at Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). During her undergraduate and master, she worked with molecular genetics focusing on identification of QTL for disease resistance in common bean. In her PhD, she is working with development of statistical models in genomic selection considering allelic dosage for autotetraploid species, with applications in *Panicum maximum*. In her internship, she was supervised by Professor Zhao-Bang Zeng at North Carolina State University (NCSU, USA) where she compared the accuracy of prediction models using diploid dosage and tetraploid dosage. She has concentrated her studies in Quantitative Genetics of polyploids, Computing for Statistical Genetics (especially in R software) and Mixed Models.
