Here we list the softwares developed and under development by the Statiscal-Genetics Laboratory and partners.

## OneMap 
Software for constructing genetic maps in experimental crosses: full-sib, RILs, F2 and backcrosses.
To install, we recommend the under development (and constrantly upgraded) version from github:
- www.github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap
Otherwise, you can install the stable version:
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html

## SuperMASSA
It is a graphical Bayesian inference tool for genotyping polyploid compatible with any quantitative genotyping methods. It was mainly developed by Oliver Serang as visiting scientist in the Lab. A suitable pipeline adapted for many markers will be released soon.
It can be found at:

## AGHMatrix
It is an R package to compute relationship matrices for diploid and autopolyploid species. It handles pedigree and molecular data with dosage. It has been developed in collaboration with [Bluberry Breeding & Genomic Lab](http://www.blueberrybreeding.com/) at University of Florida.
It can be found at:

## fullsibQTL
Software for QTL mapping in outcrossing species using composite interval mapping. It is under development and will be released soon.
